                Give any Agentic AI the right workflow and tools, and he can plan and execute at lightning speed. But here&rsquo;s the catch: drop an Agentic AI into a your critical business operation, and it&rsquo;ll quickly hit a wall. Why? Because even the smartest AI can&rsquo;t make judgment calls around risk, ethics, or strategy. Left on its own, any Agentic AI might push too far, miss a subtle trade-off, or optimize the wrong outcome.
